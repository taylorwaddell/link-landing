# link-landing

## THE GOAL:
I was sick of not being able to show off multiple links in my instagram bio. I was also for sure not going to use a web app that I could recreate in a few hours.
So I took matters into my own hands and threw together a link tree copy. The goal was to make it a template so that others could easily utilize it.

## HOW TO USE:
If you simply want to see what it looks like, the mock deployment is available [here](https://link-landing-q5ba98cqg-taylorwaddell.vercel.app/) and in the sidebar via Vercel.
  

### If you want to customize it...
The css is pretty straight forward as far as colors go. I utilized variables in the `:root` to easy make major changes.

Link Buttons - All you have to do is fill out your desired text within `<a>` tags and drop your link in the corresponding `href="LINK-GOES-HERE"` path.


For the icons, I have prefilled this section with some common services' svg icons via [Box Icons](https://boxicons.com/). Simply remove the `d-none` class
from the icons you would like to make visible. Then, paste your link into the corresponding `href="LINK-GOES-HERE"`
